# Hyperledger Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in this project, we'd love to
hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will
patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the
impact and credit the discoverer.

Please send the description of the flaw and
any related information (e.g. reproduction steps, version) to
[surnet dot org at gmail dot com](mailto:surnet.org@gmail.com).

The other way is to file a confidential security bug in our
[JIRA bug tracking system](https://jira.hyperledger.org). Be sure to set the “Security Level” to
“Security issue”.

The process by which the Hyperledger Security Team handles security bugs is documented further in
our [Defect Response page](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/SEC/Defect+Response) on our
[wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org).
